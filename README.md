# Siete Y Medio Console Game
This program will allow users to play the card game known as "siete y medio". 

The program uses C++ and requires a compiler that compiles c++-11. 
 
Functionality associated with the player drawing cards was implemented first, then an branch was created called "dealerImplementation", that was used to experiment with implemented the functionality of an automated dealer. 

Logs of the game can be found in the "gamelogs.txt" file after running the program. If the file does not exist in the directory holding the project, it will be created in said directory. 

The .gitignore was created to facilitate the compiling and running of the program on different compilers and IDE's (Integerated Development Environments). 

Thank you reading and enjoy playing "Siete y Medio!"
